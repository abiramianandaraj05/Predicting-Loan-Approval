# Predicting-Loan-Approval

In this project, I train a Decision Tree to predict whether someone will be approved for a loan

[Link to dataset](loan-approval\LoanApprovalPrediction.csv)

This is the notebook where I explain my thought process in creating my Decision Tree and details how I improve the model as well as data on how accurate the model is.

This is the python file where I import the Decision Tree and then ask the user for their own details which is then fed into the model and it will predict whether someone should be approved or not
